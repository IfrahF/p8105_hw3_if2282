Starting assignment and loading data set:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

# Problem 1:

*Description:* The dataset for Instacart contains 15 variables and
1384617 observations. Some key variables include identifiers such as
`product_id`, `user_id` and `order_id`. Other descriptory variables
include `product_name`, `department`, `reordered` and `order_dow`. The
mean number of days between orders is 17.1 days. The most popular
department for orders is *produce* and the most ordered item has been
*Banana*.

#### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

There are a total of 134 aisles, with the fresh vegetables aisle being
the one with the most items ordered,

#### Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle,n), y = n)) + 
    geom_col() +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "Aisle", y = "Count of Items Ordered ", title = "Aisles by count of items ordered") +
    geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = -0.1, colour = "purple", size = 3) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1, 165500)) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.1), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12))
```

The plot above gives the aisle names by the number of items ordered from
that specific aisle. We can see that the `fresh vegetables` and
`fresg fruits` aisle has the greatest number of items ordered on
instacart. The aisle for `butter` and `oil vinegars` has the least
number of orders. The data is arranged in descending order for reader
accessibility listing aisles from most ordered to least.

#### Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarise(times_ordered = n()) %>%
  arrange(aisle, desc(times_ordered)) %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                   | times\_ordered |
|:---------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|---------------:|
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                               |            157 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                                |            140 |
| baking ingredients         | Organic Vanilla Extract                         |            122 |
| dog food care              | Organix Grain Free Chicken & Vegetable Dog Food |             14 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe             |             13 |
| dog food care              | Original Dry Dog                                |              9 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                            |           3324 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                             |           1920 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                             |           1692 |

The table above shows the three most ordered products from the
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care` and `packaged vegetables fruits`
aisles. The most ordered product from the list being
`organic baby spinach` from the `packaged vegetables fruits` aisle which
has been ordered `3,324` times. Among the 9 listed items, the least
ordered item is the `Original Dry Dog` from the `dog food care`.

#### Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
apple_coffee = instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  select(product_name, order_dow, order_hour_of_day) %>%
  arrange(order_dow) %>%
  mutate(order_dow = recode(order_dow, "0" = "Sunday", "1" = "Monday", "2" = "Tuesday", "3" = "Wednesday", "4" = "Thursday", "5" = "Friday", "6" = "Saturday"))

apple_coffee %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "product_name",
    values_from = "order_hour_of_day",
    values_fn = mean
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

| order\_dow | Pink Lady Apples | Coffee Ice Cream |
|:-----------|-----------------:|-----------------:|
| Sunday     |             12.2 |             13.2 |
| Monday     |             11.7 |             15.0 |
| Tuesday    |             12.0 |             15.3 |
| Wednesday  |             13.9 |             15.4 |
| Thursday   |             11.9 |             15.2 |
| Friday     |             13.9 |             10.3 |
| Saturday   |             11.6 |             12.4 |

Based on the table above, we can see that `Pink Lady Apples` are usually
ordered early afternoon around 12pm on most days with the exception of
`Wednesday` and `Friday` where it is ordered around 2pm.
`Coffee Ice Cream` on the other hand is ordered mostly around 3pm
(generally when the temperature is high), with the exception of `Friday`
to `Sunday` where it is ordered a couple of hours earlier.

# Problem 2:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health" & response != "Don't Know/Not Sure" & response != "Refused") %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

#### In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?
